## Convolutional Encoder
- A Convolutional Encoder has a bit-level encoding technique. they are used in applications that require good performance with low implementation cost. Using convolutional codes, a continuous sequence of information bits is mapped into a continuous sequence of encoder output bits. The encoded bits not only depend on current inputs but also on past inputs and the storing of past input bits can be done using simple registers.
